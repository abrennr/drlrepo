# drlrepo 

## 1. Overview

*drlrepo* uses eulfedora for python-based interaction with a Fedora Commons repository.  Work right now is focused on ingest processes.  The objects in Fedora will be presented using Islandora, and so the code is based on content model definitions that are aligned with those used by Islandora.
